🚀 From Restarting My Journey… to Building a 3D Responsive Calculator!

A few months ago, I started learning HTML & CSS.
But like many beginners, I got stuck, lost consistency, and stopped learning for a while.

Recently, I decided to start again from scratch — revise the basics and rebuild my confidence step by step.
And today, I’m really proud to share one of my first polished projects:

✨ A clean, white, 3D-style, responsive Calculator UI
✨ Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
✨ With proper logic for AC, DEL, %, operators, and result handling
✨ And a clear roadmap for future improvements

What I learned during this project:

🔹 How to handle UI design from scratch

🔹 How JavaScript event listeners work

🔹 How to build real logic step-by-step

🔹 How to improve code instead of restarting every time

🔹 How to stay consistent and trust the process

What I will improve next:
🔹 Keyboard support
🔹 History panel
🔹 Dark/Light mode
🔹 Preventing double operators
🔹 More polished UI animations
🔹 Cleaner code architecture

Every line of code taught me something.
This project might be small — but for me, it represents growth, patience, and not giving up.
